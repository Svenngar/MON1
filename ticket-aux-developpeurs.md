# Ticket aux développeurs

> Dear Sir / Madam,
>
> In the past few weeks, a colleague and me tried to use your solution to monitor a Debian client as well as a Windows server 2019 client. We followed the instructions from the documentation and encountered little to no problems. We've had only one concern about your product.
>
> When we stress the CPU of a monitored server all the agents suddenly disconnect from the Pandora server. We tried to use your appliance as well as our own CentOS 7 server. Both time we had to deal with the same issue.
>
> The server does not provide any logs about that issue and both agents continued to work as intended but the Pandora server couldn't see them. We ran a tcpdump from the Pandora server and saw that both agents sent their data each 5 minutes which tells us that the Pandora server may be the problem. Could you please look into that and come back to us ?
>
> Best regards,
>
> Richard Chassot & Mehdi Karoui
